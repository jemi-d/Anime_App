Features Implemented:

- MVVM Architecture
- View Binding 
- Retrofit 2 and okHttp for the API call
- ViewModel for handle the response data 
- Glide for show the Image
- webView for video play


MVVM:
The MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern is one of the design patterns extensively used in Android app development. It helps in managing the UI of the application, making it more organized and maintainable. MVVM promotes separation of concerns by isolating the user interface logic from the business logic

Retrofit 2:
Retrofit turns your REST API into a Java interface. retrofit2.http. Annotations for interface methods to control the HTTP request behavior.

okHttp:
OkHttp is an HTTP client that's efficient by default: HTTP/2 support allows all requests to the same host to share a socket. Connection pooling reduces request latency (if HTTP/2 isn't available).


Glide:
Glide is a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface. Glide supports fetching, decoding, and displaying video stills, images, and animated GIFs.

ViewModel:
The ViewModel class is designed to hold and manage UI-related data in a life-cycle conscious way. This allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.

WebView:
Android System WebView is defined as a built-in app in Android that renders web content in other applications, enabling them to display web pages without launching a separate browser application
